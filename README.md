<h3>Topic: COVID-19 Worldwide Updates:</h3>

Since the first wave of COVID-19 has aroused, it has created havoc around the world. The rise in cases and their mutations are at an all-time high. Moreover, the strains are emerging themselves out of nowhere.
But with advancement in the field of Medical Science, vaccines with up to 95% accuracy have been discovered. However, this makes it difficult for vaccine producers to create generic vaccine due to the newer strains that are growing up in various parts of the world.
So, to keep a track of Rising Cases, Deaths and Predicting the Vaccination drive this app is useful.

<h3>Method</h3>
<ul>
  Platform: Google colabaratory 
    <li> Used Pandas Dataframe to read Datasets </li>
  <li> Data Visualization <li> Total Confirnmed cases around the World</li>
  <li> Top 10 countries by total confirnmed case</li?
  <li> Top 20 Countries by Total deaths per 1 million</li>
  <li> Daily New Cases by country</li>
  <li> Second Wave Countriy wise</li></li>
    <li> Vaccination Prediction <li> People Vaccinated per hundered</li>
    </li>
    <li>Forecasting <li> Used Prophet for Forecasting</li> </li>
  </ul>

<h4>Challenges</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I have collect datasets from different sources in order to get accurate prediction</li>
  <li>I had used Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) for forecasting, but the result was not as accurate</li>
  


<h4>Contributions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In the Refrences I have used word different techniques for prediction</li>
<li>I have used Prophet for Forecasting the time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekely, and daily seasonality.</li>
<li>I have Predicted the Data of Daily Cases, Total Vaccination and People Fully Vaccinated.</li>
<li> Using this, will be able to predict the Vaccination Drive</li>
